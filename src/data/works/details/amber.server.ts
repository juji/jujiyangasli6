A platform to detect fake videos.

Wait.. What!? that's a thing..

Like, that's a THING...



In an age where video, as one the most important media, 
gets abused with fake contents.
They created a tool to detect just that.

What a noble task...



Shamir and Roderick was the guys I worked with for this, 
I helped Roderick on the frontend and it's API.
