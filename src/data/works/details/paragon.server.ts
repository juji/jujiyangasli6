The First website of my creation, that i like. Developed with PHP, MySql.

Using CPanel as a server management tool.

It was 2012, i guess... I don't remember.

I had a great time creating this site. The client was great: 
[https://www.tauziahotels.com/](https://www.tauziahotels.com/). The designer was awesome: 
[https://visious.co/](https://visious.co/)

I worked in visious at the time. The team was cute and heart warming.
The kind of team that you would describe more as a group of friends having fun.

Click the logo to see the menu and explore. I was so proud of the page transition. There was no
react and node.js.
Just plain old PHP, mysql and an Apache Webserver.
