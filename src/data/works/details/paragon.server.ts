The First website of my creation, that i like. Developed with PHP, MySql.

Using CPanel as a server management tool.

It was 2012, i guess...

The client was [Tauzia Hotels](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tauzia-hotel-management/). The designer was 
[https://visious.co/](https://visious.co/).

This was done by creating a custom CMS, with an external booking system.

I worked in visious at the time. The team was cute and heart warming.
The kind of team that you would describe more as a group of friends having fun.
